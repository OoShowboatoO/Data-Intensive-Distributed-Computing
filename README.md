# Data-Intensive-Distributed-Computing
Assignment 7

Spark streaming: Given the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commision trip transactions data, an online streaming scenario is modeled in which trends of in-city trips are detected for the live data.

Assignment 6

Spam classification: using Apache Spark, a Linear Regression model is trained which learns a binary classification task of detecting spam files. To this end, there are two steps of implementing this system. First one is to train the classifier from the given training data using gradient descent as the optimizer, and second, to evaluate the test data.

Assignment 5

SQL big data analytics: Over a relational and structured database, which contains a set of Entity tables, specific SQL queries are performed. Each table has both of the simple text and the parquet formats, and query implementations support both types.

Assignment 4

Multi-Source Personalized PageRank: performs Personalized PageRank (extension of PageRank algorithm where the nodes are ranked based on their (explicit or implicit) connections/interactions with a source node) for multiple source nodes simultaneously. (In Hadoop)

Assignment 3

Inverted Indexing a body of text document and vocabulary and performing Information Retrieval (IR) on the indices. The codes are in Java/Hadoop

Assignment 2

This assignment has the same problems as assignment 1, but the implementations are in Spark/Scala.

Assignment 1

Written in Java/Hadoop, the goal is to compute the Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI), which is an association measure. PairsPMI and StripesPMI are two different implemenations of this algorithm in this repo.

Assignment 0

This one has the simple algorithms of Word Count and Bigram Relative Frequency written in Hadoop/Java. It covers different types of combiners and optimizations that can enhance the performance of the distributed system by taking advantage of the local node computations.
